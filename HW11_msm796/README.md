### Figure 1 : This shows the magnitude of the frequency of TLC registered vehicles (Yellow, Green and For hire vehicles) pickups in NYC during June 2018. Manhattan and Brooklyn seem to show more pickups compared to other except. It's quite notable that a particular area in Queens has a high frequenct of pickups, this is just Jamaica area which contains JFK airport.

### Figure 2 : This shows the magnitude of the frequency of TLC registered vehicles (Yellow, Green and For hire vehicles) drop-offs in NYC during June 2018. From the scale of the map, it seems like the same areas in figure 2 are lit similar to figure 1's. Maybe a more borough level investigation might reveal something interesting...
