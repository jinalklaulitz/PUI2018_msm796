## Review
The two plots/maps are visually appealing and very easy to comprehend. Here are a few improvements that could help 
* I think it's fine excluding the axes in this case, but you can add what projection the maps are in (e.g. New York State Plane, WGS 1984, etc)
* Plot the two side by side. This may be hard due to the resolution of the census blocks but if done correctly, it would be easier to compare the two.
* The two maps could be plotted using the same 'breaks'. Right now each is on it's own scale, but for comparison purposes it'd be nice if the breaks lined up with one another.
* The values in the legend should be formatted to exclude digits (since all are integers.
* Add a caption to explain what I should be looking at. Are there any differences between the two that I should notice?
